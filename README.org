#+TITLE: org-superstar-mode

* WARNING
  This package is under construction.  I am still working out the kinks.
  Any function and variable defined here *is subject to change* until
  version 1.0.0, from which point on I will try my best not to
  inconvenience people.

* TODO About
  Prettify headings and plain lists in org-mode.  This package is a
  direct descendant of ‘org-bullets’, with most of the code base
  completely rewritten.  Currently, this package supports (see footnotes
  for a quick rundown of how superstar is different from bullets):

 * Prettifying Org header lines by:
   + replacing trailing bullets by UTF-8 bullets^{[fn:a][fn:c]}
   + hiding leading stars^{[fn:b]} or customizing their look^{(new!)}
   + applying a custom face to the header bullet^{[fn:d]}
   + applying a custom face to the leading bullets^{(new!)}
 * Prettifying Orb plain list bullets^{(new!)} by:
   + replacing each bullet type (‘~*~’, ‘~+~’ and ‘~-~’) with UTF-8 bullets^{[fn:c]}
   + [ ] applying a custom face to item bullets

* Installation

  Once ready, this package will likely be available using =package.el=.

  A manual installation is as simple as plugging =org-superstar.el= into
  your load path and adding the following to your =.emacs=:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'org-superstar)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-superstar-mode 1)))
#+END_SRC

* Customization
  A variety of customization features has been added to allow further
  tweaking.  Suggestions are always welcome!

  *NOTE:* Many of the variables listed below require you to restart
  ~org-superstar-mode~ to take effect.  See the see the corresponding
  variable's documentation.

** "Can you make it more like =org-bullets=?"
   Naturally!  In fact, I made the answer to this it's own function:

*** ~org-sstar-configure-like-org-bullets~
    This function configures ~superstar-mode~ to be as similar to
    =org-bullets= as possible.  Since this function automatically sets
    various custom variables, it should only be called *once* per
    session, before any other (manual) customization of this package.

    ~org-sstar-configure-like-org-bullets~ is only meant as a small
    convenience for people who just want minor depatures from
    ~org-bullets-mode~.  For a more fine-grained customization, it’s
    better to just set the variables you want.

** Custom UTF8-Bullets for heading lines
   Here's how you change which bullets are used for which level.

*** ~org-sstar-headline-bullets-list~
    Those of you familiar with =org-bullets= will be recognize this
    list: It's a list of single-character strings where the /Nth/ entry
    is used to determine the bullet used for heading level /N/.  By
    default, this list is cycled through for /N/ greater than the length
    of the list.

*** ~org-sstar-cycle-headline-bullets~
    This variable gives you more control over how ~superstar-mode~ picks
    headline bullets.  The default, ~t~, cycles through the list as
    explained above.  Other values are:

    * ~nil~ :: Go through the list, then repeat the last entry
               indefinitely.
    * any integer /k/ :: Cycle through the first /k/ elements of the list.

*** ~org-sstar-leading-bullet~
    Maybe you actually /like/ that org's heading lines are connected to
    the left margin, but you find a line of stars too visually busy?
    Enter ~org-sstar-leading-bullet~.  Provide a character of your
    choice to be displayed instead.  Strings are superimposed
    according to the rules of ~compose-region~.  =org-superstar= ships
    with a subtle [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_(typography)][leader]] as the default.

*** Hide leading stars and ~org-sstar-prettify-leading-stars~
    Since ~org-mode~ already takes care of hiding leading stars by
    providing the dedicated variable ~org-hide-leading-stars~ and it's
    associated face ~org-hide~, there is no extra option for /hiding/
    leading stars.  However, you can stop ~superstar-mode~ from
    prettifying them by setting ~org-sstar-prettify-leading-stars~ to
    ~nil~.

** Custom UTF8-Bullets for plain lists
   Why stop at heading lines?  Customize the look of your list bullets
   to make plain lists a little less so.

*** ~org-sstar-item-bullet-alist~
    Since the concept of "levels" does not really apply to lists, this
    association list simply assigns a UTF-8 character to each of the
    three possible bullet characters for plain org lists.

*** ~org-sstar-prettify-item-bullets~
    Exactly as it says on the tin.  Set this variable to ~nil~ to stop
    ~org-superstar-mode~ from prettifying lists.

** Custom faces


* Footnotes

[fn:a] These features are mostly the same as in ~org-bullets-mode~.
[fn:b] Plain hiding is now left to org-mode and the associated
variable ~org-hide-leading-stars~ as well as ~org-hide~, as suggested
by [[https://github.com/Kaligule][Kaligule]].
[fn:c] ~org-superstar-mode~ tries to prettify in a context-sensitive
fashion: It strives to only recognize heading lines which are really
*meant* to be heading lines.  Your ~SRC~ blocks are safe!
[fn:d] Instead of providing the symbol of an existing face in a
variable to replace org's usual title face(s) for the UTF-8 character,
superstar merges a custom face with the face that would have been
used, allowing the user to inherit the level-dependent default look.
